# D’s Method – Project Status

## STATUS: COMPLETE ✅

### Core Components
- Correct D’s Method equation (σₜ scaled sentiment)
- Sentiment decay & confidence weighting
- Rolling FIFO buffer (40 rows)
- Realized short-horizon volatility σₜ
- Execution with normalization & hysteresis
- Backtest variants V0–V3
- Frozen numeric model (fnum)

### Validation
- Directional accuracy
- Information coefficient (IC)
- RMSE
- Regime-aware testing

### Notes
- This is a research-grade MFT system
- No execution over-optimization
- No look-ahead bias
- Ready for:
  - paper writing
  - controlled experiments
  - further refinement if desired

## FINAL STATE
✔ COMPLETE
